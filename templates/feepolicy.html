            <b>Note: Payments owed by members will be deducted from the security deposit. If the security deposit does not cover such payments, the balance must be paid by the member electronically.
            </b><br><br>
<b>*</b>Please note there are four cases where there will be exceptions:<br><br>

<br>In the event the member is found to be under the influence of alcohol during a booking, the member will be held liable for 100% of the vehicle damage bill as per the invoice received from the vehicle workshop.<br>

<br>The member will be liable for 100% of the entire vehicle damage bill in the event that the vehicle workshop and/or insurance company deem the damage to be consequential in nature (this will be clearly stated in the accident report).<br>
            Consequential damage occurs when the member continues driving even after an external vehicle impact, thereby severely undermining the condition of the vehicle.
<br>In the event a non-Adrenture member is found to be the one driving at the time of accident, then the member will be held liable for 100% of the vehicle damage bill as per the invoice received from the workshop.<br>
<br>

<b>Member's Responsibility</b><br>
If a Adrenture member is violating the law or Adrenture rules, for example by overspeeding or driving drunk, the member will be responsible for all damage, liability, and fines and could face legal action.
<br><br>

The Member will be obligated to pay the repair cost up to ₹ 10000. The payment owed will be deducted from the security deposit, if any. Should the security deposit not cover the payment (in the case the Member has accrued late return, excess km, etc charges) the balance of the payment owed shall be payable by the Member separately as an additional outstanding.
<br><br>Member will be responsible for all towing and impounding charges associated with a collision.
